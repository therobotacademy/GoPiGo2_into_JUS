## Firmware v15

This firmware has upgrades for the hardware changes coming to the GPG v16 but is backward compatible. 

The firmware has removed the support for the IR receiver which would be added back in the future update

Firmware v15 might cause your GoPiGo to stop working. Please use this on your own risk and do report any problems that you encounter in the forums.
