## Firmware v14

This firmware has upgrades for the hardware changes coming to the GPG v16 but is backward compatible. 

The firmware also brings support to the IR receiver which can be now used to control the GoPiGo.

Firmware v14 might cause your GoPiGo to stop working. Please use this on your own risk and do report any problems that you encounter in the forums.
