# Program the GoPiGo in Scratch

You can program the GoPiGo in Scratch.  This repo contains support programs and example programs to help you program the [GoPiGo](http://www.dexterindustries.com/GoPiGo) in Scratch.

The GoPiGo is a delightful and complete robot for the Raspberry Pi that turns your Pi into a fully operating robot.  GoPiGo is a mobile robotic platform for the Raspberry Pi developed by [Dexter Industries.](http://www.dexterindustries.com/GoPiGo).

## Sensor Placement
You can add a number of Grove sensors to the GoPiGo.  Sensors must be placed in the correct port to work.

 	
| Sensor | Port |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Ultrasonic | A1 |
| Button | A1 or D11 |
| Sound Sensor | A1 |
| Buzzer | D11 |
| LED | D11 |
| Motion Sensor | D11|
| Infrared Receiver	| A1 |
| Line Sensor | I2C |
