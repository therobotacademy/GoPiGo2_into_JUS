# Agent KK Guard Robot

Build and program this little GoPiGo to protect your wardrobe, your closet, or even your whole room! Hide GoPiGo behind a closed door and when the door is opened, it will attack your siblings, scaring them, and even taking a picture as trespassing proof! That way, even mom will have to be on your side!
