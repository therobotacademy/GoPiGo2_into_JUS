# GoPiGo Trubleshooting Script

The scripts here are for finding the common problems with the GoPiGo.

To run the test, make the complete_test.sh executable:

> sudo chmod +x complete_test.sh

and run it:

> sudo ./complete_test.sh

Choose option 6 to run all the tests. This might take a few minutes.

Once the tests are completed, a *log.txt* file would be created on the Desktop. Send this by email or post it on the forums.
